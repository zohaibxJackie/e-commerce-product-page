## My process
- Analysing the design
- writing the a HTML
- writing the css
- Adding logic with Javascript

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to design an e-commerce page, and to be honnest, I have never done that before. It was a very good experience. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I want to continue working on the javascript used in this project. The logic I used is very lengthy and I don't
like it. So, if someone wants to improve the javascript, feel free to do it.
